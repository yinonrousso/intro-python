# Assignment 1
Your task is to create a function called getPower which will take two parameters.
The first argument is a list of size *n* containing the base values and the second is a 
list of size *n* containing the exponent values. 
You should calculate the corresponding exponential values for every pair in these two array's.
Recall: Exponents have the followig form:
base<sub>exp</sub>

## Example Input 1 ## 
nums = [1,2,-3]
exponents = [2,4,2]

## Example Output 1 ##
answer = [1,16,9]

## Example Input 2 ## 
nums =      [7,2,3,9,-5,0,4]
exponents = [2,8,1,2,3,97,3]

## Example Output 2 ##
answer = [49, 256, 3, 81, -125, 0, 64]
